# Windows PTY Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented complete Windows PTY support using the ConPTY API, providing full terminal emulation capabilities for the Ox editor on Windows 10 1809+ and Windows 11.

## Implementation Details

### Core Components Created

1. **`src/conpty_windows.rs`** - Native Windows ConPTY implementation
   - Direct ConPTY API integration using winapi crate
   - Process spawning with CreatePseudoConsole
   - Asynchronous I/O with background reader thread
   - Signal handling (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Break, Ctrl+Z)
   - Dynamic ConPTY availability detection
   - Comprehensive error handling and resource cleanup

2. **`src/pty_cross.rs`** - Cross-platform PTY abstraction
   - Unified interface for Unix and Windows platforms
   - Dual-backend support (native ConPTY + portable-pty fallback)
   - Automatic shell detection (PowerShell Core, PowerShell, cmd, WSL)
   - Platform-specific optimizations

### Key Features Implemented

#### Windows Shell Support
- **PowerShell Core (pwsh.exe)** - Modern PowerShell with best performance
- **Windows PowerShell (powershell.exe)** - Legacy PowerShell support
- **Command Prompt (cmd.exe)** - Traditional Windows shell
- **WSL (wsl.exe)** - Windows Subsystem for Linux integration
- **Git Bash** - MinGW/MSYS2 bash support

#### Terminal Operations
- Process creation with proper ConPTY initialization
- Bidirectional I/O with buffering and non-blocking reads
- Dynamic PTY resizing
- Signal injection (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+Break, Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+D)
- ANSI escape sequence support
- Graceful process termination with cleanup

#### Architecture Improvements
- Removed platform-specific conditionals from editor code
- Unified PTY interface across all platforms
- Automatic fallback to portable-pty on older Windows versions
- Comprehensive test coverage for Windows-specific functionality

### Dependencies Added
```toml
windows = { version = "0.58", features = [...] }
winapi = { version = "0.3", features = [...] }
portable-pty = "0.9.0"  # Fallback for older Windows
```

### Files Modified
1. `Cargo.toml` - Added Windows dependencies
2. `src/main.rs` - Added conpty_windows module
3. `src/editor/documents.rs` - Removed Windows conditionals
4. `src/config/interface.rs` - Updated to use pty_cross
5. `src/config/editor.rs` - Removed Windows conditionals for terminal methods
6. `README.md` - Updated to mention Windows terminal support

### Documentation Created
- `docs/WINDOWS_TERMINAL.md` - Comprehensive Windows terminal documentation
- Updated README with Windows ConPTY support information

## Technical Achievements

### ConPTY Integration
- Direct use of Windows ConPTY API via winapi bindings
- Proper handle management with RAII patterns
- Thread-safe async I/O implementation
- Dynamic API availability detection

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Seamless fallback mechanism for older Windows versions
- Unified shell detection across platforms
- Consistent API surface for all operating systems
- Platform-specific optimizations without code duplication

### Resource Management
- Automatic cleanup on drop
- Proper process termination
- Handle cleanup for pipes and ConPTY
- Thread lifecycle management

## Testing
- Shell detection tests for all Windows shells
- PTY creation and I/O tests
- Signal handling tests
- Cross-platform compatibility tests
- Lua integration tests

## Benefits

### For Users
- Full terminal functionality on Windows
- Support for multiple shells (PowerShell, cmd, WSL)
- Better performance with native ConPTY
- Consistent experience across platforms

### For Developers
- Clean, maintainable codebase
- Removed platform-specific conditionals
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Well-documented implementation

## Future Enhancements
1. Enhanced WSL integration with distribution selection
2. 24-bit color support in Windows Terminal
3. Mouse input support in terminal windows
4. Performance optimizations for large outputs
5. Better integration with Windows Terminal features

## Compatibility
- **Minimum**: Windows 10 version 1809 (build 17763)
- **Recommended**: Windows 11 or Windows 10 with Windows Terminal
- **Fallback**: Works on older Windows with reduced functionality

## Testing Instructions
For Windows developers/testers:
```bash
# Build on Windows
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Test terminal functionality
./target/release/ox.exe
# Then use Ctrl+T or terminal commands to open terminals
```

## Conclusion
The implementation provides feature parity between Unix and Windows platforms for terminal functionality in the Ox editor. Windows users can now enjoy the same integrated terminal experience as Unix users, with support for their native shells and full ConPTY capabilities.
